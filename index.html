    Hello, my name is Caleb Phillips and this is my pottery. It is named for
    the black-billed magpie (<em>pica hudsonia</em>) a conspicuous and charismatic resident
    of the Colorado plateau. A convenient homograph is the medical condition pica, which
    causes those afflicted to seriously consider eating dirt. It's maybe not recommended
    to do this unless your name is Hayduke. That being said, I can relate to the impulse.
    <br /><br />
    The concept of this pottery is for 100% of proceeds from pottery sales to go to charitable causes.
    Because the dollars can have a larger impact there, the focus is on vetted international charities.
    <em style="font-weight: bold;">
    In 2023, funds raised through the sale of my pots will go to support
    <a href="https://www.karmaflights.org/planetary-health-camp-2023">Womens' health in rural Nepal</a>.

    I did my initial pottery training with Liz Alymer and Jenny Stock at the <a href="http://www.artesaniadelprado.es/">Artesania del Prado</a> nearby to Olvera, Andalucia, Spain. I've also had the wonderful opportunity to practice at a 
    number of community studios and learn from the residents there:
    <a href="https://ceramicsacademy.co.uk/home/">Ceramics Academy</a> 
    with <a href="https://tazpollardceramics.com/">Taz Pollard</a> in South Molton, Devon, UK; 
    <a href="https://www.ceramiques.com.au/">CÃ©ramiques</a> in Melbourne, Australia; 
    <a href="https://www.stjohnsclay.com/">St. John's Clay</a> in Portland, Oregon, USA;
    and the 
    <a href="https://www.waikatopotters.co.nz/">Wakatipu Society of Potters</a> in Queenstown, New Zealand. 
    <br /><br />
    While I am still developing my own aesthetic, I am most inspired by the pottery-as-trade including 
    functional domesticware made in the production style. I am thankful for inspiration from many contemporary
    potters, including those who have been so kind to invite me into their studios and share their craft. 
    For my own work, I aim to embrace the geologic and geographic context that surrounds me. I 
    use clay bodies sourced from Colorado and New Mexico, and design glazes to complement the clay. I appreciate
    organic, simple forms which emphasize function and are comfortable to use.
