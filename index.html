    Hello, my name is Caleb Phillips and this is my pottery. It is named for
    the black-billed magpie (<em>Pica hudsonia</em>) a conspicuous and charismatic resident
    of the Colorado plateau. 
    <br /><br />
    The concept of this pottery is for proceeds from pottery sales to go to charitable causes.
    Because the dollars can have a larger impact there, the focus is on vetted international charities.
    <em style="font-weight: bold;">
    In 2023, funds raised through the sale of my pots will go to support
    <a href="https://www.karmaflights.org/planetary-health-camp-2023">Womens' health in rural Nepal</a>.
    </em>
    In 2024, funds will provide medical supplies to civilian defenders through  
    <a href="http://www.sunflowerseedsukraine.com">Sunflower Seeds Ukraine</a>.
    <br /><br />
    I did my initial pottery training with Liz Alymer and Jenny Stock at the <a href="http://www.artesaniadelprado.es/">Artesania del Prado</a> nearby to Olvera, Andalucia, Spain. I've also had the wonderful opportunity to practice at a 
    number of community studios and learn from the residents there:
    <a href="https://ceramicsacademy.co.uk/home/">Ceramics Academy</a> 
    with <a href="https://tazpollardceramics.com/">Taz Pollard</a> in South Molton, Devon, UK; 
    <a href="https://www.ceramiques.com.au/">CÃ©ramiques</a> in Melbourne, Australia; 
    and the 
    <a href="https://www.waikatopotters.co.nz/">Wakatipu Society of Potters</a> in Queenstown, New Zealand. 
    <br /><br />
    I make functional domesticware in the production style, taking inspiration from high desert and mountain landscapes of the western USA. I am also thankful for inspiration from many contemporary production potters, including those who have been so kind to invite me into their studios and share their craft.
